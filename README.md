Introduction
Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This project aims to develop a data science solution for detecting brain tumors in medical images using various machine learning techniques. Brain tumors are a critical medical condition, and early detection is essential for improving patient outcomes.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to train, evaluate, and utilize brain tumor detection models based on data science methodologies.

Project Overview
Brain tumor detection is a challenging task due to the complexity and diversity of brain images. The primary objective of this project is to build an accurate and robust model capable of distinguishing between brain scans with and without tumors. Here's a high-level overview of the project's components:

Data Collection: Obtain medical imaging datasets containing brain scans, including both tumor and non-tumor samples.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and augment the data to improve the model's generalization and performance.

Model Development: Utilize various data science techniques like traditional machine learning algorithms, to create brain tumor detection models.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
