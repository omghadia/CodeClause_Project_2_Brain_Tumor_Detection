Introduction : Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This project aims to develop a data science solution for detecting brain tumors in medical images using various machine learning techniques. Brain tumors are a critical medical condition, and early detection is essential for improving patient outcomes.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to train, evaluate, and utilize brain tumor detection models based on data science methodologies.

Project Overview : Brain tumor detection is a challenging task due to the complexity and diversity of brain images. The primary objective of this project is to build an accurate and robust model capable of distinguishing between brain scans with and without tumors. 

Here's a overview of the project's components:
1. Data Collection: Obtain medical imaging datasets containing brain scans, including both tumor and non-tumor samples.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and augment the data to improve the model's generalization and performance.
3. Model Development: Utilize various data science techniques like traditional machine learning algorithms, to create brain tumor detection models.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision and recall scores.

Dataset : The success of this project heavily relies on the availability of high-quality medical imaging data. However, due to privacy and ethical concerns, medical imaging datasets are not always freely available.
For this project, I have utilized the  Brain Tumor Dataset, which consists of brain MRI scans collected from multiple medical centers. The dataset contains labeled images, with each image categorized as either "Tumor" or "Non-Tumor." If you wish to access the dataset, please follow the instructions provided in the data directory.

Methodology : The project uses the following methodologies for brain tumor detection:
1. Data Preprocessing: This includes image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to increase the model's robustness.
2. Feature Extraction: For traditional machine learning algorithms, relevant features are extracted from brain images.
3. Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using various metrics.

Results : The performance of the brain tumor detection models is documented in the results directory. This includes accuracy, confusion matrices, and other relevant evaluation metrics for each model.
